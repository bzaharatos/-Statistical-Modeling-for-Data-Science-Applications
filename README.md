#  Statistical Modeling for Data Science Applications

This repository contains datasets and some materials related to the Coursera specialization titled "Statistical Modeling for Data Science Applications". The specialization contains three courses: (1) Modern Regression Analysis; (2) ANOVA and Experimental Design; and (3) Generalized Linear Models and Nonparametric Regression. 

 Statistical modeling lies at the heart of data science. Well crafted statistical models allow data scientists to draw conclusions about the world from the limited information present in their data. In this three credit sequence, learners will add some intermediate and advanced statistical modeling techniques to their data science toolkit. In particular, learners will become proficient in the theory and application of linear regression analysis; ANOVA and experimental design; and generalized linear and additive models. Emphasis will be placed on analyzing real data using the R programming language.
